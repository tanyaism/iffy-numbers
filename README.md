# iffy-numbers

How the game works:
->When a user rolls the dice, the users current score keeps increasing corresponding to the number on the dice, as long as the number is not 1.
->If the number is one,the turn switches to Player 2.
->As the current score accumulates, if the user chooses they can hold their current score.In this case current score gets added to the total score board and turn switches to another player
->if any users total score is atleast 100 then that user wins and either player can no longer roll the dice or hold points.
->only the new game functionality remains active at this point.
